# SkillSwap Security Documentation

This document outlines the security considerations, best practices, and potential risks associated with the SkillSwap smart contracts.

## Security Features

The SkillSwap contracts incorporate several security features:

1. **Access Control**: Ownable pattern for administrative functions
2. **Reentrancy Protection**: ReentrancyGuard used to prevent reentrancy attacks
3. **Input Validation**: Extensive validation of inputs to prevent invalid states
4. **Pausable Functionality**: Critical contracts can be paused in emergencies

## Known Limitations

1. **Centralized Admin Control**: Contract owners have significant power
2. **Dependency on XDC Network**: Platform is dependent on XDC network stability
3. **Oracle-Free Design**: Current design doesn't use oracles for external data

## Security Best Practices for Integration

### Frontend Integration

1. **Wallet Security**:
   - Never store private keys in frontend code
   - Use secure wallet connection libraries
   - Allow multiple wallet options

2. **Transaction Security**:
   - Always verify transaction parameters before signing
   - Provide clear confirmations to users
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Data Validation**:
   - Validate all inputs before sending transactions
   - Check contract state before operations
   - Handle errors gracefully

### Contract Interaction

1. **Session Management**:
   - Verify session details before payment
   - Check mentor credentials before booking
   - Validate session parameters

2. **Payment Processing**:
   - Always check token allowances before transactions
   - Verify payment amounts
   - Confirm transaction success

## Audit Status

As of [Current Date], the SkillSwap contracts have not undergone a formal third-party security audit. Users should proceed with appropriate caution.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue. Instead, email security@skillswap.example.com with details.

## Future Security Improvements

1. **Planned Third-Party Audit**: Contracts will undergo professional security audit
2. **Timelock for Admin Functions**: Implementing delay for sensitive operations
3. **Multi-Signature Control**: Moving toward multi-sig administrative control
4. **Upgradeability Path**: Developing secure upgrade mechanisms
